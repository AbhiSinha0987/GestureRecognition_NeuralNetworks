# GestureRecognition_NeuralNetworks
There are 5 Gestures which we want the Neural network to learn – <br>
•	Thumbs up:  Increase the volume <br>
•	Thumbs down: Decrease the volume <br>
•	Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds <br>
•	Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds<br>
•	Stop: Pause the movie <br>

As part of this experiment, we have trained 2 different model types – <br>
•	Convolution 3D<br>
•	CNN(2D) + RNN <br>

# GestureRecognition_NeuralNetworks
There are 5 Gestures which we want the Neural network to learn – 
•	Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
•	Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
•	Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
•	Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
•	Stop: Pause the movie

As part of this experiment, we have trained 2 different model types – 
•	Convolution 3D
•	CNN(2D) + RNN
